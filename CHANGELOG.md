##0.2.0

Bugfix
- Duplicate node verification was too strict

Feature
- added "/harvest datalog NODETYPE" to return the number of nodes in the database
For example "/harvest datalog nodes" will tell you how many nodes and what kind are being used by HarvestMap


Note: It was reported that craglorn data was made unavailable after 2.4.7.  I need copies of both the HarvestMap.lua and HarvestMerge.lua files in order to resolve and test the issue correctly.  If you can please PM me with a link to a downloadable file from a website I don't have to register for, I would appreciate it.
