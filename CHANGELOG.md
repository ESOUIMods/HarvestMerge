##0.1.4

Updates
- Added craglorn support to localization files

Note: It was reported that craglorn data was made unavailable after 2.4.7.  I need copies of both the HarvestMap.lua and HarvestMerge.lua files in order to resolve and test the issue correctly.  If you can please PM me with a link to a downloadable file from a website I don't have to register for, I would appreciate it.
